                            The medium Voltage will be either 230 Volts single phase or 400 Volts three phase.

                            The nature and location of service lines and other supply facilities shall be determined by the Operator. The Operator shall be at liberty at any time to take branch
                            services off the service lines whether on the customer premises or not, for the purpose of supplying electricity to any other premises. The customer shall obtain all
                            facilities required by the Operator for the installation of the service line including the necessary Right of Way over his own and/or adjacent property which the
                            Operator may require. Any service line or other facilities provided by or donated by a consumer shall be treated in line with the Investment in Networks Regulation
                            by the Commission.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            <h5>ACCESS TO PREMISES</h5>
                            The customer shall give the Operator all reasonable and necessary access to the customer’s premises for the purpose of connecting, disconnecting, inspecting,
                            testing, altering, replacing, maintaining or removing any service line, meter and/or other apparatus or any part thereto and for reading the meter. The Operator’s

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <h5>ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT</h5>
                            After the installation referred to in schedule 2.1 hereof has been tested and passed by the Operator, the customer shall not have any additional equipment
                            connected to his installation without submitting an application form EEDC 74 to the Operator giving at least seven days notice of his intention to do so,
                            and he shall not use such additional equipment until the installation has been re-tested and passed by the Operator. Neglect of this precaution may cause
                            interruption of supply and damage to EEDC Equipment. A penalty may be imposed for default.

                            Should the customer or the Operator gives notice disputing the accuracy of a meter, such meter shall be tested by the Nigerian Electricity Management Services
                            Agency (NEMSA). If the Customer considers his meter inaccurate, his notice to that effect shall be accompanied by a deposit to cover the cost of the test. In the
                            event of the meter having an error exceeding the line of error as may be allowed by the regulation in force, the amount payable for electricity charge for the period
                            for which the customer is charged on the last invoice rendered prior to the notice of dispute shall be determined in line with the provisions of NERC’s Regulation
                            on Meter Reading, Billing, Cash Collection and Credit Management

                            installation from another Customer.<br/>
                            The Operator reserves the right to discontinue supply of electricity for purposes of safety, when other Customers are being connected or when the Operator’s
